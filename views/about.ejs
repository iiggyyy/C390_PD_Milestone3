        <p>Hi, I’m a Digital Design and Development student based in Singapore, currently in my second year at Republic Polytechnic’s School of Infocomm.</p>
        <p>While my course covers both design and development, I’m more drawn to the design side. I enjoy building interfaces that are clean, clear, and easy to use.</p>

      <div class="about-text">
        <p>In my free time, I play competitive FPS games like Valorant and CS, and I’m also into racing simulators such as F1, rally, and WEC. These games have shaped how I think about design, especially in terms of precision, clarity, and fast decision-making.</p>
        <p>I try to stay focused and detail-oriented, and I always aim to produce work that feels considered and well put together.</p>
